Interactive Information Aggregation for Video Content

This is just the first prototype to showcase the idea behind a rich interaction with the a video source. It's a very early alpha version and got plenty of issues besides many hacks in code.
But first the idea: I aimed to develop a video player for touch interfaces that goes beyond simple playback of the source. It should aggregate all accessible information an include it into the video.
First, before the movie starts, you will see all static information that is available. Sources from IMDB, Rotten Tomatoes, TMDb, you name it.

While movie is running, you should be able to select an actor's face to get more informations immediatelly.

Soundtrack is recognized when music plays. Informations to the scene as well as user somments should be presented in real-time in later development stages.
